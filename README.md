# weather-app-simply-tkinter-imgw

A simple weather app, made during my early days of learning Python Tkinter. After the user enters a city, it gives weather data after downloading it from the servers of IMGW - Polish Meteorological Institute. We also have a function program here, with a GUI and downloading data from an external API :)
